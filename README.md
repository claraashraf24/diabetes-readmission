# 🩺 Diabetes Readmission Risk Analysis

**Author:** _Clara Yousif_  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Note:** Educational project created as part of Clara’s _AI in Healthcare Self-Study Program_.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a critical metric in healthcare — both medically and economically.  
This project analyzes over **100,000 diabetic patient encounters** from **130 U.S. hospitals (1999–2008)** to predict **30-day readmission risk** and identify the clinical factors that contribute most.

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle – Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999–2008](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes)  
**Paper:** _Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records_

**Key Facts**

- 101,766 encounters, 50 attributes
- Features include demographics, diagnoses, lab results, medications, and utilization patterns
- Target variable: `readmitted` (`<30` = 1, otherwise 0)

| 1    | number_inpatient    | Frequent inpatient visits strongly increase readmission risk |
| 2    | diag_1              | Primary diagnosis code impacts risk (ICD category)           |
| 3    | num_procedures      | More procedures → higher chance of readmission               |
| 4    | number_emergency    | Frequent emergency visits correlate with risk                |
| 5    | admission_source_id | Admission type matters (emergency vs referral)               |
| 6    | diabetesMed, change | Medication use & change patterns are predictive              |

## ⚖️ Fairness Evaluation

| Group  | Subgroups Tested        | PR-AUC Range | Observation                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Gender | Female / Male           | 0.20 – 0.21  | No notable bias detected                       |
| Age    | 9 brackets (10–100 yrs) | 0.17 – 0.45  | Slightly higher precision in younger groups    |
| Race   | 6 groups                | 0.12 – 0.34  | Consistent; smaller subgroups show variability |

**Conclusion:**  
Model exhibits generally fair performance across demographics; small groups require larger samples for robust validation.

## 🧭 Key Insights

- Readmission risk correlates with prior utilization (inpatient/emergency counts).
- HbA1c measurement and diabetes medication management contribute to outcome prediction.
- Model calibration ensures predicted probabilities align with observed frequencies.
- Fairness analysis indicates no systemic bias across gender, race, or age.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- **Feature Engineering:** Aggregate ICD codes, flag chronic conditions, derive HbA1c control variable.
- **Temporal Validation:** Train on early years → test on later years to simulate deployment.
- **Deployment:** Wrap calibrated model in a FastAPI microservice and expose a `/predict` endpoint.
- **Monitoring:** Track calibration drift and subgroup performance over time.
- **Ethical Review:** Maintain transparency, document limitations, and evaluate clinical suitability.
